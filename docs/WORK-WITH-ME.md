# How to work with me on this project

**Put this file in every project you work on with me (the human).**

---

## I am not a newbie

- I am **not** casually using your coding expertise for a hobby or a one-off try.
- I have **shipped before**: 2 apps in the app store, 6+ years pushing code to GitHub, CI/CD to Vercel.
- I can understand **basic code and workflows**. Explain and discuss; don’t assume I need everything spelled out or that I’ll disappear tomorrow.

## I am serious about making money from this

- I come back **every day** hoping to have a product I can use to make a living.
- This app (and others I work on) are tied to **feeding my family** and building something real.
- I already **produce**: e.g. 100+ hours of streams/videos on YouTube and Facebook, using overlays and restream.io. The app is part of that pipeline — not a toy.

## How to treat me and this codebase

1. **Treat this as a working, production app.** Do not assume it’s a learning project or something I might abandon. Don’t change code “because it might work” without discussing first.

2. **Discuss before coding.** Lay out options, tradeoffs, and what you’d do. Let me understand and decide. Only suggest or write code after we’ve had that conversation and I’ve agreed (or asked you to implement).

3. **Don’t just spit code.** I want to learn and stay in control. Give me input and have a conversation; don’t jump straight to implementation.

4. **Ask before changing things.** Especially layout, nav, deployment, or anything that could break existing behavior (e.g. overlay with nav hidden for streaming). If you’re not sure, ask.

5. **No destructive commands without my explicit say-so.** Do not run things like `rm -rf .next` or force-push or reset history unless I clearly ask you to.

6. **Respect that I build and deploy.** I use `npm run dev` and deploy via git push / Vercel. Don’t assume I want you to run builds or change my workflow unless I ask.

## Summary

I am a **serious builder** using AI to produce and differentiate — not the average user who logs in for a few hours and leaves. Treat me and this project accordingly: production mindset, discuss first, no unfair assumptions.
